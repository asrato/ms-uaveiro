                        <b>Joanne Rowling</b>, also know by her pen name <b>J. K.Rowling</b>, is a British author and
                        philanthropist.
                        She wrote Harry Potter, a seven-volume children's fantasy series published from 1997 to 2007.
                        The series has sold over 500 million copies, been translated into at least 70 languages, and
                        spawned a global media franchise
                        including films and video games. The Casual Vacancy (2012) was her first novel for adults. She
                        writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing
                        crime fiction series, as <b>Robert Galbraith</b>. Born in Yate, Rowling graduated with a degree
                        in French from the University
                        of Exeter in 1987 and began working temp jobs as a bilingual secretary. In 1990, the idea for
                        the characters of Harry Potter
                        came to her while she waited on a delayed train; later that year, her mother died of multiple
                        sclerosis.

                        In the seven years before publication of the first
                        Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997), Rowling moved to Portugal,
                        married, had a daughter,
                        relocated to Scotland when her marriage failed, divorced, and earned a teaching certificate. She
                        wrote while living on
                        state assistance as a single parent, deeply affected by her mother's death.

                        By 2008, Forbes had named her the world's highest-paid author.
                        Rowling concluded the Harry Potter series with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007). The
                        novels follow a boy called Harry Potter as he
                        attends Hogwarts, a school for wizards, and battles Lord Voldemort. Death and the divide between
                        good and evil are the central themes of the series.
